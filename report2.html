        <h1>Report 2: Malware Static Analysis (Ukraine 2022)</h1>
        <h3>Yll Morina</h3>
        <h3>02/05/2026</h3>
        <p>
          This report shows the steps I used to analyze a malware sample linked to attacks on Ukrainian organizations in 2022.
          I focused on static analysis and used public research to confirm what the malware is.

        <h2>1. Sample Information</h2>
        <p>
          I started by opening the file in PE-bear to collect the hashes and confirm the file identity.
        </p>
        <p><strong>SHA-256:</strong> a64c3e0522fad787b95bfb6a30c3aed1b5786e69e88e023c062ec7e5cebf4d3e</p>

        <h2>2. VirusTotal Check</h2>
        <p>
          Next, I searched the SHA-256 hash in VirusTotal to confirm if it is already known and how many engines detect it.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>3. File Type and Basic Details</h2>
        <p>
          I used Detect It Easy (DIE). It showed the sample is a PE32 file (32-bit, x86) and looks like it was built
          to be compatible with Windows XP. This usually means it can also run on newer Windows versions.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Sections and Packing Signs</h2>
        <p>
          I checked the PE sections and looked at entropy. Some sections had high entropy, which usually means the file is packed
          or encrypted. This is a common malware trick to hide the real code.
        </p>

        <img src="images/report2/Screenshot 2026-02-05 144805.png" alt="Entropy / packed sections">

        <h2>5. Imports Look Obfuscated</h2>
        <p>
          Imports did not look normal. They seemed missing or malformed (spoofed imports). That suggests the malware probably loads
          Windows APIs at runtime instead of listing them normally. This makes analysis harder.
        </p>

        <h2>6. I Tried FLOSS (Strings) But It Failed</h2>
        <p>
          I tried running FLOSS on the sample in normal mode and also with verbose options.
          Every time it crashed with a UnicodeDecodeError. That’s another sign the file is packed or intentionally malformed.
        </p>

        <h2>7. PEStudio Strings (Most Were Gibberish)</h2>
        <p>
          I opened the file in PEStudio and reviewed the strings. Most were unreadable, but near the end there were interesting
          readable strings related to disk paths and system locations. This can point to disk-level activity.
        </p>

        <img src="images/report2/Screenshot 2026-02-05 143110.png" alt="PEStudio strings list">

        <h2>8. Certificate / Signature Info</h2>
        <p>
          PEStudio showed a digital certificate, but it did not verify. Malware sometimes uses stolen or abused certificates
          to look legitimate.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Correlating With Public Research (CISA)</h2>
        <p>
          At this point I was still not fully sure what the malware was doing, so I researched the hash and found a CISA advisory
          that explains the malware campaign used against Ukraine in 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          CISA Advisory:
          <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-057a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            AA22-057A
          </a>
        </p>

        <h2>10. Final Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the packed/obfuscated PE structure, broken imports, unreadable strings, and the matching public reporting from CISA,
          I concluded this sample is part of the destructive malware activity described in the advisory.
